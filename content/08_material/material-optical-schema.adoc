== metadata

The key meta information about the optical look-up table.


*Type:* `+object+` +
*Required:* Yes

=== name
The display name of the material, such as 'Red brick' or 'Dark asphalt'.

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Required:* Yes


=== description
Short description of the material in 2 - 3 sentences.

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Required:* No


=== uuid
Universally unique identifier for the material in 8-4-4-4-12 format, see cite:[uui]. The uuid stays the same, even if version is updated.

=== materialVersion
The version number of the material, following semantic versioning (for example, '1.0.0').

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Pattern:* `+^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$+` +
*Required:* Yes


=== openMaterial3dVersion
The version of the ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D specification used, adhering to semantic versioning (for example, '1.0.0').

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Pattern:* `+^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$+` +
*Required:* Yes


=== copyrights

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Required:* Yes


=== authors
Lists the author(s) of the material as a name, email, or company.

*Type:* `+array+` +
*Required:* Yes




=== creationDate
The date and time of material creation, formatted as YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ according to ISO 8601 cite:[iso8601] (for example, '20240703T101728Z').

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Pattern:* `+^\\d{8}T\\d{6}Z$+` +
*Required:* No


=== sources
Sources of the optical property data. Was it measured, simulated, or taken from literature? Multiple sources should be comma-separated.

*Type:* `+string+` +
*Required:* Yes


== opticalProperties




*Type:* `+array+` +
*Required:* Yes

Array of optical property values, with each item representing a different property. The array shall be sorted based on the columns starting with the first.

Columns of the table:

- Column 1: Wavelength of radiation in free-space in meters (m). The value shall be within the range of 1e-09 to 17.16e-03 (upper limit corresponds to 20 kHz).
- Column 2: Temperature of material in Kelvin (K). The value shall not be below 0.
- Column 3: Real part of index of refraction of material, which is \(n^{'}\) in \(n = n^{'} - j \kappa\).
- Column 4: Imaginary part of index of refraction of material, which is \(\kappa\) in \(n = n^{'} - j \kappa\).
